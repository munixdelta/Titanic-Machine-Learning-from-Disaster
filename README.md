# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster

This project is based on the Kaggle “Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster” competition.
The objective is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck using
machine learning classification techniques.

This is a binary classification problem where the target variable is:
- Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

Dataset:
- train.csv : Passenger data with survival labels
- test.csv : Passenger data without labels
- sample_submission.csv : Submission format for Kaggle

Project Workflow:
- Data loading and exploration
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical features
- Feature scaling
- Model training
- Model evaluation
- Prediction and submission generation

Models Used:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest (or other classifiers)

Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

Evaluation Metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

This project is intended for learning and practicing machine learning fundamentals,
especially classification, feature engineering, and model evaluation using a
well-known real-world dataset.
